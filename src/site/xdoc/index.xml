    <section name="About Harvest Tool">
      <p>The Harvest Tool provides functionality for capturing and indexing product metadata. The tool will run locally at the Discipline Node to crawl the local data repository in order to discover products and index associated metadata with the Search Service. The Tool additionally stores the entire product label contents into another index within the Search Service.
